    "## Rocket Equation Explained âœ¨\n",
    "The rocket equation, also known as the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, is a fundamental equation in astronautics and aerospace engineering that describes the motion of a rocket in terms of its mass and the velocity of the exhaust gases expelled from the rocket engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "![https://i.stack.imgur.com/muq3d.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/muq3d.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Image Source](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/634816/tsiolkovsky-rocket-equation-with-external-force)\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation is expressed by the following:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta v = v_e \\cdot \\ln \\left( \\frac{{m_0}}{{m_f}} \\right) \\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Î”v`: the change in velocity of the rocket\n",
    "\n",
    "â€‹\n",
    "`ve`: effective exhaust velocity of the rocket engine\n",
    "\n",
    "`m0`: initial total mass of the rocket (including propellant)\n",
    "\n",
    "`mf`: final total mass of the rocket (after the propellant is expelled)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Thrust\n",
    "Thrust is a force that propels an object forward. For a rocket, thurst is generated using a propulsion system (rocket engine).\n",
    "According to Newton's 3rd Law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n",
    "Thrust in a rocket is produced by expelling propellant in one direction which in turn creates a reaction force in the opposite direction that propels the rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thrust can be calculated using the following equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J = mv\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's solve for the force of thrust \n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{thrust} = J / t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can plug in values for J\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{thrust} = mv / t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And then rearrange \n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{thrust} = (m / t) * v\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice `m / t` represents the rate of change of propellant mass which is referred to as the `mass flow rate` which we can represent as `dm/dt`\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{thrust} = \\frac{dm}{dt} * v\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deriving the Rocket Equation\n",

    "#### Force of Upward Thrust\n",

    "$$\n",

    "#### Force of Mass Expelled\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J_{propellant} = V_{escape} * dm\n",

    "\n",
    "`Vescape`:  the escape velocity of the propellant \n",
    "\n",
    "`dm`: change of propellant mass \n",

    "J_{rocket} = J_{propellant} \n",
    "$$\n",

    "Where we can plug in the defined values above to get:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{rocket} * dv = V_{escape} * dm\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to get the change of velocity, we need to take the integral... let's first separate the equation according to its terms:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dv = V_{escape} * dm * (1 / M_{rocket})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the integral from the boundaries `vf - vi` and `mf - mi` respectively:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_{vi}^{vf} dv = V_{escape} * \\int_{mi}^{mf} dm * (1 / M_{rocket})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, take the integral of the right side of the equation:\n",
