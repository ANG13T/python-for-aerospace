    "## Understanding FITS Files \n",
    "FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files are a standardized format commonly used in aerospace and astronomy for storing various types of data, including images, tables, and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "FITS Files are used primarily for the following purposes:\n",
    "- Astronomical Images captured by telescopes and other instruments\n",
    "- Spectral Data which represents the intensity of electromagnetic radiation (light) as a function of wavelength or frequency\n",
    "- Tabular Data for specific measurement observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural Breakdown\n",
    "- A FITS file is segmented by Header/Data Units (HDUs).\n",
    "- The first HDU (aka Primary HDU) contains a primary data array typically representing a 1-D spectrum, a 2-D image, or a 3-D data cube\n",
    "- Additional HDUs are referred to as `Extensions` and they contain auxiliary information such as:\n",
    "1. Image Extensions contain a 0-999 dimensional array of pixels\n",
    "2. ASCII Table Extensions store tabular information with all numeric information stored in ASCII formats\n",
    "3. Binary Table Extensions store tabular information in a binary representation \n",
    "\n",
