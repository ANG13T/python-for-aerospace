ISS Instrument Kernel
==============================================================================
 
   This instrument kernel (I-kernel) contains references to the mounting
   alignment, internal and FOV geometry for the Cassini Imaging Science
   Subsystem (ISS) instruments.
 
 
Version and Date
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   The TEXT_KERNEL_ID stores version information of loaded project text
   kernels. Each entry associated with the keyword is a string that consists
   of four parts: the kernel name, version, entry date, and type. For example,
   the ISS I-kernel might have an entry as follows:
 
           TEXT_KERNEL_ID += 'CASSINI_ISS V0.0.0 29-SEPTEMBER-1999 IK'
                                  |          |         |            |

            --   The value of IFOV for the NAC recorded in previous kernels as
                 60 should have been 6. The value associated with
                 INS-82360_IFOV and the table in the documentation have been
                 updated to reflect this correction.

   Version 0.1 -- October 8, 1999 -- Scott Turner
 
            --   Added an additional set of keywords that describe the FOVs of
                 the instruments to maintain compatibility with previously
                 discussed standards. These keywords may change or be
                 eliminated when the kernel evolves. Placeholders for the NAC
                 and WAC radiators were also placed into keywords conforming
                 to this standard.
 
            --   Altered the NAC/WAC FOV definition parameters to conform with
                 GETFOV's expectations. Added documentation describing the

Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH
   and CSPICE routine furnsh_c load SPICE kernels as shown below:
 
   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)
 
           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )
 
   C (CSPICE)
 
           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )
 
   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.
 
   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.
 
 
Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF Cassini spacecraft ID number (-82) followed by a
   NAIF three digit ID code for the ISS instruments. (NAC = 360, WAC = 361).
 
   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the ISS NAC boresight direction in the
   ISS NAC optics frame (``CASSINI_ISS_NAC'' -- see [2]) is specified by:
 
           INS-82360_BORESIGHT
 
   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.
 
   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.
 
 
ISS description
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   From [3]:
 
   ``IMAGING SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM (ISS)
 
   The Cassini orbiter imaging experiments will encompass a wide variety of
   targets (Saturn, the rings, Titan, the icy satellites, and star fields) and
   a wide range of observing distances for various scientific purposes. The
   science objectives include studying the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan,
   the rings of Saturn and their interactions with the planet's satellites,
   and the surface characteristics of the satellites, including Titan. Because
   of these multiple objectives, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) has two
   separate camera designs. The first is a narrow-angle camera (NAC) design
   that will obtain high-resolution images of the target of interest. The
   second is a wide-angle camera (WAC) design that provides a different scale
   of image resolution and more complete coverage spatially. The spacecraft
   will carry one NAC and one WAC. The NAC is also used to obtain optical
   navigation images for the mission with the WAC acting as a functionally
   redundant backup unit for this purpose.
 
   The cameras are charge-coupled device (CCD) imagers. A CCD is essentially a
   large-scale integrated circuit (IC) that has a two-dimensional array of
   hundreds or thousands of charge-isolated wells, each representing a picture
   element or "pixel." Light falling on a well is absorbed by a
   photoconductive substrate, such as silicon, which releases a quantity of
   electrons proportional to the intensity of the light. The CCD detects and
   stores an accumulated electrical charge representing the light level on
   each well. These charges are subsequently read out for conversion to
   digital data. CCDs are much more sensitive to light of a wider spectrum
   than vidicon tube-type imagers, and they are less massive, require less
   energy, and interface more easily with digital circuitry.
 
   The Cassini imagers differ primarily in the design of the optics. The NAC
   has a focal length of 2000 mm, and the WAC , which uses optics inherited
   from the Voyager mission, has a focal length of 200 mm. The cameras each
   have a focal plane shutter of the same type as used on both Voyager and
   Galileo, and they have a two-wheel filter-changing mechanism derived from
   the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) design. The
   CCD detector is cooled to suppress dark current (residual current in the
   CCD beyond that released by incident light), which is dependent upon
   temperature. It is also shielded from ionizing radiation.
 
   The CCD detector design is a square array of 1024x1024 pixels, each pixel
   12 micrometers on a side. The IC chip will use three-phase,
   front-side-illuminated architecture, with a coating of lumogen phosphor to
   provide ultraviolet response. The detector is passively cooled by a
   radiator to approximately 10 degrees C below its nominal operating
   temperature (approximately minus 90 degrees C), and then it is controlled
   to the operating temperature by a proportional control heater. To minimize
   radiator size and heater power, the detector/radiator combination is
   thermally isolated from the rest of the camera head assembly (CHA).
 
   The entire NAC is thermally isolated from the remote sensing pallet (RSP)
   on which it is mounted in order to minimize the effects of RSP thermal
   variations on NAC image quality. The WAC, being an inherited design with
   less stringent imaging requirements, is not thermally isolated.
 
   The electronics for each camera are identical. All ISS command and
   telemetry functions will be handled by the electronics, including receipt
   of commands from the Command and Data Subsystem, expansion of commands, and
   collection and transmission of imaging data and telemetry to the CDS.
 
   The ISS controls the amount of power it draws from the spacecraft during
   operations. To accomplish this, the profile of ISS command timing is
   structured to reduce the power the ISS requires for certain internal
   functions (e.g., shutter or filter wheel movement). When the filter is
   moving, the power from the optical heater (if present) in the active camera
   is turned off. When the movement is complete, the optical heater is turned
   on (if needed). In addition, simultaneous filter positioning within a
   single camera, either the WAC or NAC, is not permitted.
 
   During the cruise phase of the mission, the cameras will periodically be
   turned on for maintenance, calibration, and monitoring of instrument health
   and performance. Other than these specified times, the ISS will be off and
   replacement heaters will be on. In addition, decontamination/radiation
   heater 1 will be on throughout most of the cruise.
 
   Upon arrival at the Saturnian system, the cameras will be on most of the
   time. Spacecraft power limitations will be the controlling parameter
   determining whether the ISS will be turned off or put into a low-power
   state. During the Saturn tour, high-activity periods for Saturn and its
   rings will be clustered around periapsis (the point in the orbit closest to
   the planet); for the satellites, the high-activity periods will be when the
   spacecraft is closest to them. At these times, high-resolution images of
   all targets will be acquired through various camera filters, and the data
   will be stored in the spacecraft solid-state recorder (SSR). During lower
   activity periods (i.e., when the spacecraft is orbiting farther from the
   targets), long-term atmospheric and ring monitoring will take place, and
   ISS calibrations will be performed.''

   Note that although the above diagram suggests that the NAC and WAC
   boresights are co-aligned, this is not the case. As [1] and [2] point out,
   the NAC and WAC are both mounted to the Remote Sensing Palette in different
   locations. From [6], the CCD samples and lines increase with decreasing X
   and Y in the NAC and WAC frames. Thus the (0,0) corners of the CCDs are as
   illustrated on the diagram above.
 
   The FOVs of the ISS detectors have the following angular sizes (from [4]):

   The keywords INS[ID]_FOV_FRAME, INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE, INS[ID]_BORESIGHT, and
   FOV ANGLES specification keywords defined below are used to describe the
   instrument field of view. Since both the NAC and WAC have square fields of
   view, the INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE keyword will always be 'RECTANGLE', and GETFOV
   will return the four vectors in the instrument frame that describe the
   edges of the FOV cone. Both the NAC and WAC boresights lie along the
   Z-axis.

Wide Angle Camera (WAC) FOV Definition
 
   Since the WAC is also a square field of view, similar calculations as to
