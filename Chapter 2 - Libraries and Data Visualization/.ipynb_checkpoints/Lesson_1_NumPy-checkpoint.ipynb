    "In aerospace and astronomy, many core packages are commonly used to perform various tasks, including numerical simulations, data analysis, visualization, and more. Here are some essential packages for each field:\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy`: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "`scipy`: SciPy is built on top of NumPy and provides additional functionality for scientific and technical computing. It includes modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, signal processing, linear algebra, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib`:Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a MATLAB-like interface for generating plots and graphs, making it suitable for visualizing aerospace data. \n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas`: Pandas is a powerful data analysis and manipulation library that provides data structures and functions for working with structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`astropy`: Astropy is a core package for astronomy in Python, providing a wide range of tools and utilities for astronomical data analysis and modeling."
