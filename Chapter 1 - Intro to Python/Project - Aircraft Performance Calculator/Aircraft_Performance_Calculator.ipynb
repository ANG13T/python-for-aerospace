    "## Propulsion Systems üèéÔ∏è\n",
    "Propulsion refers to the process of pushing an object forward by producing thrust. \n",
    "\n",
    "On aircraft, thrust is generated by accelerating a fluid (yes, air is considered a fluid!) to create a force.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Newton's Third Law\n",
    "Propulsion on aircraft is possible because of Newton's Third Law which states:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Air is accelerated by the engine, and the reaction to this acceleration produces a force on the engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Thrust with Propellers:\n",
    "When a propeller spins, its blades are designed to create a pressure difference between the front and back surfaces as they move through the air. This pressure difference results in air being accelerated backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the propeller accelerates air backward, according to Newton's third law, there is an equal and opposite reaction force pushing the propeller forward.\n",
