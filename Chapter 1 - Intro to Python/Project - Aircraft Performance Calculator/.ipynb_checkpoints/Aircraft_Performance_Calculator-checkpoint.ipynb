    "## Propulsion Systems üèéÔ∏è\n",
    "Propulsion refers to the process of pushing an object forward by producing thrust. \n",
    "\n",
    "On aircraft, thrust is generated by accelerating a fluid (yes, air is considered a fluid!) to create a force.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Newton's Third Law\n",
    "Propulsion on aircraft is possible because of Newton's Third Law which states:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Air is accelerated by the engine, and the reaction to this acceleration produces a force on the engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Thrust with Propellers:\n",
    "When a propeller spins, its blades are designed to create a pressure difference between the front and back surfaces as they move through the air. This pressure difference results in air being accelerated backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the propeller accelerates air backward, according to Newton's third law, there is an equal and opposite reaction force pushing the propeller forward.\n",

    "### Generating Thrust with Engines:\n",
    "In an aircraft, the engine produces a force by expelling exhaust gases backward. According to Newton's third law, this action of expelling gases backward creates an equal and opposite reaction force, pushing the aircraft forward.\n",

    "## Atmospheric Conditions üå§Ô∏è\n",
    "Atmospheric conditions play a crucial role in the performance of propulsion systems, affecting parameters such as thrust generation, engine efficiency, and overall aircraft performance. Examples of atmospheric conditions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Air Density: \n",
    "Mass of air molecules per unit volume. It decreases with altitude, meaning that the air is less dense at higher altitudes. Propulsion systems rely on air to generate thrust, and denser air contains more molecules for the engine to work with. Engine tend to perform better in lower altitudes because the air density is greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temperature: \n",
    "Temperature affects air density, with warmer air being less dense than colder air. In colder temperatures, air molecules are closer together, leading to higher air density. Conversely, in warmer temperatures, air molecules are more spread out, resulting in lower air density. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pressure: \n",
    "Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, which also affects air density. Lower pressure at higher altitudes means fewer air molecules available for propulsion systems to work with, resulting in reduced thrust output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Humidity: \n",
    "Humidity, or the amount of water vapor in the air, can affect engine performance. Moist air is less dense than dry air, which can slightly decrease engine efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wind:\n",
    "Wind speed and direction can impact aircraft performance during takeoff, landing, and flight. Headwinds can increase airspeed, improving engine performance and reducing takeoff and landing distances. Tailwinds, on the other hand, can decrease airspeed and may require longer runway lengths for takeoff and landing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Turbulence:\n",
    "Atmospheric turbulence, caused by factors such as wind shear and convective currents, can affect the stability and efficiency of propulsion systems.\n",
