# Prerequisites and Set Up

### Tools you will need:
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

## Step 1: Downloading Python
To download Python, head over to the website below and follow the download instructions:
[https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)

To ensure you have Python downloaded, run the following command in your terminal after installation:
```
python --version
```
You should get a version number as your output, like the following:

If you get an error, you will need to install pip using Python. To do so:
1. Download the script `get-pip.py`, from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
2. Run the command below:
```
python get-pip.py
```
3. Run `pip -V` again to check if it worked!

## Step 3: Downloading Anaconda:
Download Anaconda using the latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.9):
